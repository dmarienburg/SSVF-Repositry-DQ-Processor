Release Notes:
v1.11--Minor Update
Release Date: 7/14/2015

  What's New:
    Added "Very High Income (Entry)" and "Very High Income (Exit)" catagories to the dropdown menu.
    Cleaned up setup.py so that version information displays correctly in the compiled .exe

v1.1--Full Public Release
Release Date: 7/13/2015

  Added code documentation and increased regex efficiency with this release.
  
  There is still no internal testing in the code so that will be coming in a future release though I am quite
  confident that everything is working as it should based on the couple of times I used v1.0.
  
  At this point I'm releasing the program to the greater SSVF community.
  
  Please contact me with any issues you find in the software.  I hope this helps make those long VA .pdf files more o
  a usefull data quality tool.

v1.0--Full Release--Internal Only
Release Date: 04/11/2015

  All functionality is present in this version but the code is poorly documented and there are no internal tests.
